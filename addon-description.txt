TOC: Headings, Landmark Regions and Links

Summary
-------
The Table of Contents (TOC) for Headings, Landmarks and Links extension provides information on the headings, landmark regions and links in a web page.  The associated headings, landmark regions and links in the side panel can be highlighted in the web page for easy identification.  The extension is designed to help people identify and navigate to content of interest.  The extension can be used as part of accessibility testing to verify the proper use of headings and landmark regions, and to ensure link names identify the destination of the link.
