                <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Verify the <em>title</em> of a web page provides a description of both the website and the specific page.  The specific page information should be the first part of the title followed by the website information.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    People using screen readers hear the <em>title</em> first when the page is loading and using screen reader commands have the <em>title</em> read to them to understand which web page they are viewing.
