# Headings, Landmark Regions and Links

## Summary
The Headings, Landmarks and Links (H2L) extension provides information on the headings, landmark regions and links on a web page in a browser side panel.  The associated headings, landmark regions and links in the side panel can be highlighted in the web page for identification.  Information can be exported to a CSV formatted file to be viewed in spreadsheets.  The extension helps people identify and navigate to content of interest.  The extension can be used as part of accessibility testing to verify the proper use of headings and landmark regions, and to ensure link names identify the destination of the link.
